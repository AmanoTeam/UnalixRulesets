# Unalix rules

This repository hosts the custom ruleset used by [UnalixAndroid](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/UnalixAndroid). It mainly targets tracking fields commonly found in mobile applications/websites, but can be used as a generic/general purpose ruleset too.

## Contributing

Pull Requests are always welcome.

If you want to add some new entries to the rulesets file, create a Pull Request or fill a issue.
But before anything else, make sure to get yourself familiar with the [ClearURLs rules catalog specification](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/latest/specs/rules).
